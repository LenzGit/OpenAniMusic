## Disclaimer

Please note that this project was originally developed for personal use. At the time, I did not plan on releasing it publicly, which is why the codebase is currently quite unstructured and lacks proper documentation. I apologize in advance for any confusion this may cause.

Most comments—if present—are written in German and have not yet been translated into English. I do plan to improve the code structure and add proper documentation at some point, but realistically, this won't happen in the near future.

## Feedback

If you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to open an issue or reach out. Any feedback is welcome!

Thank you for your understanding and interest in this project.
